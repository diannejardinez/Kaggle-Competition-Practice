# Kaggle Competition Practice: Housing Prices Competition 

**Objective**: Predict the sales price of individual residential property in Ames, Iowa from 2006 to 2010. For each Id in the test set, a prediction value should be populated for the SalePrice variable.

Disclaimer: `submission.csv` is not coded for optimal prediction. Currently the file has a high Root-Mean-Squared-Error (RMSE) score between the logarithm of the predicted value and the logarithm of the observed sales price.
